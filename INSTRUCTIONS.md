Instructions for Validating the ToDo App Deployment
This document contains instructions for validating the correct deployment of the ToDo application and its Ingress configuration.

1. Validate the Application Deployment
1.1. Check the Application Deployment
Run the following command:

bash
kubectl get deployments -n todoapp
Expected Output:

The todoapp deployment should have 1 replica (DESIRED, CURRENT, and READY should all be 1).

1.2. Check the Application Pods
Run the following command:

bash
kubectl get pods -n todoapp
Expected Output:

The pod should be in the Running state.

1.3. Verify Application Logs
Check the logs of the application pod to ensure it has started successfully:

bash
kubectl logs <todoapp-pod-name> -n todoapp
Expected Output:

Look for messages indicating that the application has started successfully (e.g., "Application started" or "Connected to database").

1.4. Verify Application Connectivity
Port-forward to the application pod to test connectivity:

bash
kubectl port-forward <todoapp-pod-name> 8080:8080 -n todoapp
Open your browser and navigate to http://localhost:8080. Verify that the application is accessible and functions as expected.

2. Validate the Ingress Configuration
2.1. Check the Ingress Resource
Run the following command:

bash
kubectl get ingress -n todoapp
Expected Output:

The todoapp-ingress should be listed with the correct host and port.

2.2. Test the Ingress Rule
Access the application via the Ingress host (e.g., http://todoapp.example.com). Ensure that the application is accessible and functions as expected.

3. Cleanup (Optional)
If you want to clean up the resources after validation, run the following commands:

bash
kubectl delete -f deployment.yml -n todoapp
kubectl delete -f service.yml -n todoapp
kubectl delete -f ingress.yml -n todoapp
By following these steps, you can validate that the ToDo app and its Ingress are correctly deployed and functioning as expected.
